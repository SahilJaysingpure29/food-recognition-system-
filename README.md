🥗 Food Item Recognition & Calorie Estimation Model
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent deep learning-based system that can identify food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to make informed dietary decisions and track their nutrition effectively.

The model can be used in mobile apps, fitness trackers, or dietary planning platforms to simplify calorie counting through image recognition.

✅ Key Features
🔍 Image Classification: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify different food categories from images.

🧠 Calorie Estimation: Each food class is associated with a pre-defined average calorie count for quick estimation.

📊 Dataset-Driven Learning: Trained on a labeled food image dataset with multiple food categories.

📱 User-Friendly Use Case: Can be integrated into diet-tracking apps or camera-based food loggers.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Pandas

Google Colab
